# c-vote
FreeCodeCamp Basejump - build a voting app

Objectives:

check - As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.

check - As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.

check - As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.

check - As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.

check - As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.

check - As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.

check - (Chart.js) - As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form.

check  - User Story: As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.

This is my first app in MEAN Stack. I feel like some parts of this is the worst code ever written, but it works in most cases. 
It needs some UX improvements in the future, but for now i'm done - took me more than a month, and required a few approaches
to do it properly.
